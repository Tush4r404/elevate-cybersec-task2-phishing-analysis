IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS
==========================

- Sender email appears to be from GitHub but uses 'github-support.com', not the legitimate 'github.com'.
- Suspicious link: https://github-support.com/verify-account (hover reveals fake domain).
- Urgent and threatening language: "permanent suspension" and "deletion of repositories".
- Generic greeting: "Dear GitHub User" instead of your actual username.
- Return-path domain is unrelated 'github-alerts.com'.
